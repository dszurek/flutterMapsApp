I am still actively working on this application, and will update this as time goes on. 

Images of application running can be found in the Images folder of the Wiki.

NOTE

I am only including code that I write myself, so main.dart is not included. Some assembly required if trying to run on your own machine. 
You must initialize your own flutter project, and add this code to it. I am also excluding the API keys needed for this to function (OpenRouteService, Google Places, and MapBox tiles) so you will need to input your own into the code.
