I am still actively working on this application, and will update this as time goes on. 

Images of application running can be found in the Images folder of the Wiki.

NOTE
I am only including code that I write myself, so main.dart is not included (some assembly required if trying to run on your own machine, also have to initialize a flutter project).
I am also excluding the API keys needed for this to function (OpenRouteService, Google Places, and MapBox tiles) so you will need to input your own.


KNOWN ISSUES

* This application runs fine on MacOS as far as I can tell, tested on an Intel Macbook Pro 
* However, if running on Windows through Google Chrome, search bar functionality does not appear to work
* Occasionally, routes will not begin at the location of the user

PLANNED FEATURES

* Turn-by-turn navigation screen with information on next turns and distance to them
* Cleaner UI design
* Ability to change certain settings
